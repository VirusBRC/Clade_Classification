# Clade Classification 

The United States Government Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, owns the copyright to the accompanying software under FAR 52.227-14 (c). 

The swine H1 clade classification tool classifies the clade of the HA/H1 viruses from any host and for any NA subtype, with reference to the global swine H1 clade scheme and the US swine H1 classification scheme. This tool infers the clade for a query sequence from its position within the reference tree. 

      Refer to SOP_SwineH1CladeClassn_062415.pdf for more details on US Swine H1 Clade Classification.
      Refer to the SOP_Global_Swine_H1_Clade.pdf for more details Global Swine H1 Clade Classification.

The highly pathogenic H5N1 clade classification contains the code to enable the algorithm for classifying the clade of the hemagglutinin gene of influenza A(H5) viruses. It uses phylogenetic analysis to classify HA (H5) sequences (from both highly pathogenic Goose/Guangdong-like viruses and from non-pathogenic Eurasian and American lineage viruses) according to the WHO classification scheme. It has been verified as highly accurate (> 98%) for sequences of at least 300 nucleotides of HA1. Refer to the 'IRD_H5_CLADE_SOP.pdf' for more details.

The procedure was developed as a collaboration by Virus-BRC Co-investigator Catherine Macken (U of Auckland), Tavis Anderson and other swine influenza experts at the US Department of Agriculture.
